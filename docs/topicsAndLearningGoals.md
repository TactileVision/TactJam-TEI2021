# TOPICS
* Introduction to tactile perception and vibrotactile patterns in general (tactons)
* Hands-on design of tactons through a simple instrument-like device (TactJam)
* Sharing tactile experiences with others: discussing bodily experiences and design processes
* Identifying similar design strategies of vibrotactile cues

# LEARNING GOALS
* A good understanding of basic modalities of the tactile sense
* Knowledge of methods to explore spatial vibrotactile feedback
* Knowledge on mapping visual intentions to tactile intentions
* Bodily experiences of tactons based on individual preferences
* Derived dos and donâ€™ts for the design of tactons and the hands-on design process
